  <div class="story">
    It was a sunny afternoon in Dreamland, and Kirby was on a mission that day. Today, he was going to spend his day at the beach! 
    The sand was soft and warm, like a heated blanket. The waves crashed with a "shhhhhh" sound as they brushed to the shore and tickled at Kirby's feet. The sound was gentle enough to lull him into the comfiest naps. 
    The gentle waves carried Kirby out, out, out - not too far, just far enough. The water was calm and shimmered under the shining sun. 
    Kirby floated, his arms and legs spread wide as the water rocked him like a cradle while the seagulls flying high above sang their songs. It's as if the whole beach was singing a lullaby just for him. 
    As the sky turned orange, Kirby began to drift back to shore. After drying himself off, Kirby watched the sunset and witnessed the stars slowly begin to illuminate themselves in the endless sky. 
    Tomorrow brings new adventures, but tonight, Kirby drifts to sleep wrapped in the sea's hush and the stars' comfort.
